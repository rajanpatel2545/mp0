  <p>I am a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
    I am interested in web programming and machine learning applications.</p>
  <p>I have worked on projects and internships that helped me build strong 
    skills in programming and problem solving. I just got a new phone so I do not have any pictures of myself. I just put
    a picture of a football because it is one of my favorite sports to play.</p>
